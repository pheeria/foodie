From Wolt website, using four locations of Berlin.
This resulted in 2048 unique restaurants.

> Is this production-ready?

No ðŸ˜…
It's missing:
- defensive programming against network calls
- asynchoronous calls
- logging/tracing
- tests (load tests, e2e tests, stress tests, unit tests)

> Why are there no tests?

Initially there used to be `pytest` included into requirements, however because of the small scope, there is not much logic to test, apart from the json transformations.

> Why are there no formatters and/or linters?

I have Pyright installed locally and my OCD doesn't let me write misaligned code. That's definitely a need for a project with multiple people involved.

> Is there anything missing in the UI?

Keyboard navigation for the Autocomplete and some accessibility improvements.

> What can be done better for Search?

- Filtering with facets
- Availability awareness
- Location/deliverability awareness
- Synonyms
- Expansions and classifications

> Is there any tracking?

Take a look into the Dev Tools console!
